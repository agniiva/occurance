Hi, I’m Agniva Mahata.

I’m passionate about technology, human interaction, and storytelling. With over five years in tech and startups, I’ve had the privilege of working with a variety of organizations, from innovative startups to established companies and NGOs. Currently, I lead [CashCowLabs](https://cashcowlabs.io), an organic growth agency for SaaS, and [Ganjes](https://www.ganjes.net/), a venture capital firm.

Alongside my work in AI, ML, and business innovation, I nurture a love for writing stories as I continue to learn and explore new ideas. My journey is all about building meaningful connections and chasing bold, creative visions.

Happy reading.
